# MachineLearningDemo
A demo to show scikit-learn to implement regression and classification.

## Files
The repo contains the following files:
- <code>regression.py</code> : a simple Liner Regression model to predict the Salary of an employee based on the years of experience. It works with the 'Salary_Data.csv' file.
